/**
 * Follows one chat: reads its stored events, then takes the `run_event`s of the stream, and gives the page the
 * conversation's entries. Events are pushed into the conversation as they come and the page is told at most once per
 * animation frame, so a fast answer redraws a few dozen times a second, not once per streamed piece. After the socket
 * connected again the events it missed are read.
 *
 * A chat is opened at its last message and read backwards from there, a page of events at a time, until the window
 * holds `MESSAGE_WINDOW` entries or the log runs out. Reading a long chat from its first event made the page wait for
 * messages nobody was going to scroll up to — a run of a few thousand events was a wall of text before its first line
 * appeared — so what is above the window waits for `loadOlder`, which is what scrolling to the top of a conversation
 * is for.
