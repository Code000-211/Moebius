/**
 * The floating chat (the desktop app's `float_chat`): a round button at the bottom right of every page that opens a
 * sheet with the Moebius agent over the page. The sheet is a borderless card down the right that leaves the page
 * recognisable behind it; Escape, or the control that minimises it, closes it and the focus goes back to the button
 * that opened it. Minimising turns it back into the button and the chat stays across pages. Every message carries
 * where the person is, which only the agent is told; the first one starts a chat of origin `assistant` (the Chat page
 * leaves it out of its list), in the repository of the page when it has one, and the later ones go to the same chat.
 * A chat whose agent went away is taken up again with what was said in it, as on the Chat page; one the agent ended
 * is left behind, and the next message starts a new conversation.
