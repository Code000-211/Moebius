// From BloopAI/vibe-kanban packages/ui/src/components/ChatBoxBase.tsx (Apache-2.0), changed: no i18n, drag and drop,
// visual variants or header; the box is a card of the surface colour with a soft shadow rather than a bordered panel,
// or one row inside a sheet (`inline`),
// and a refusal is said by the shared Notice above the field. Whether the agent works is said once, by the
// conversation and by the page's hint, so the box itself stays out of it.
