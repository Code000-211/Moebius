//! What the board engine, the chats and the improvement runs need of a harness, one trait for each caller: `CardRuns`
//! starts, steers and stops the runs of cards, `ChatRuns` serves the chats, and `ImproveRuns` starts the Retro, the
//! Autoresearcher and the trials. `Runs` is all three, which the server holds. Pi-Bolt (`pibolt`) and Claude Code
//! (`claude`) are the real ones, and `Harnesses` looks up which of them an agent runs on; the tests also use fakes.
//! No method has a default, so a harness that lacks one does not compile.
