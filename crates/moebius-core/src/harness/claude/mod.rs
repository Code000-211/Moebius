//! The Claude Code harness: each run is Claude Code's command line, `claude -p --input-format stream-json
//! --output-format stream-json --verbose`, in the run's worktree, with the router as its only provider
//! (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) and the run's token as its key, on the agent's model, with the agent's instructions
//! (`--append-system-prompt`), skills and MCP servers. Claude Code has no bridge, so the run's token is a checked one:
//! the router checks every tool call in the answers to it and replaces a refused one by a text that names the rule (see
//! `router`). Each message is a JSON line on its stdin; what it writes is mapped to the run events Pi-Bolt's runs have
//! (see `reader`), so the board, the web app and the Retro read both alike.
//!
//! A run of a card, of the Retro analyst or of the Autoresearcher ends after its answer: stdin is closed at the first
//! `result`, and the run ends when Claude Code exits; what the agent left is committed as for Pi-Bolt. A steer is
//! another user message, which Claude Code answers before it exits. A chat keeps its Claude Code between messages and
//! ends when the person ends or stops it; a chat given another model gets a new Claude Code that resumes the chat's
//! session (`--resume`). A chat on Claude Code has no terminal interface, does not pause when idle and ignores the
//! reasoning level, which Claude Code's command line does not take. Stopping a run kills its process.
//!
//! `process` writes a run's configuration directory, builds the command line and starts it; `reader` reads what it
//! writes and ends the run.
