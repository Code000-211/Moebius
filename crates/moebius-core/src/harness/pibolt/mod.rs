//! The Pi-Bolt harness (spec 4): each run is `pi-bolt --mode rpc` in the run's worktree, with the router as its only
//! provider. The prompt goes in as one JSON line; every record Pi writes is stored as a run event and published on the
//! bus. Records are split on LF only, never on U+2028 or U+2029, which are valid inside JSON strings. The run ends at
//! `agent_settled`; what the agent changed is committed on the run's branch and the worktree is removed. A chat is
//! the exception: its Pi stays up at `agent_settled`, the run waits for the person's next message, and it ends when
//! the person ends or stops it (or Pi exits). A chat works in a worktree on `moebius/chat-<id>` or, without a
//! repository, in an empty directory; what it left is committed on the branch when it ends, and when the branch
//! then has commits beyond the default branch they are offered as a change without a card. A `code` run
//! that changed nothing, that is, left no change and made no commit, has failed; other runs, such as a review, are not committed. A run starts from the branch of the
//! card's latest successful `code` run, so it sees the work so far. The text of the agent's final answer is kept as
//! the run's summary. A run is stopped with `abort` and steered with `steer`. Pi runs offline and does not trust
//! configuration found in the worktree, and loads only the extensions, skills and MCP servers the agent is configured with (see `mcp`). The
//! Moebius bridge (`bridge/moebius-bridge.ts`) is loaded into every run after the agent's own extensions, so that it
//! sees the final input and content of each tool call; it asks the check for each tool call and result (see `check`). Every run is told the path of the
//! `moebius` executable as `$MOEBIUS`. The Moebius agent is always available: its instructions are built in, its skills
//! are the guide and the task skills (see `skill`), and its model comes from `[agents.Moebius]` or else from the Coder. The Retro analyst
//! (see `retro`) is built the same way; its run works in a worktree of the harness configuration repository. So is the
//! Autoresearcher (see `research`), whose run works in a worktree of the repository it researches. A person can also
//! open a waiting chat in Pi-Bolt's own interactive mode (`tui`), and it stays one conversation: the chat's idle Pi is
//! ended, Pi's interactive mode continues the chat's session (`--continue`, the same agent directory, sessions and run
//! token), and what it adds to the session file is recorded as the chat's events (see `session_events`). When the
//! interface closes, the chat's Pi starts again with `--continue` and waits for the next message. A chat can run on
//! another model and reasoning level than its agent's (see `ChatSettings`), with which its Pi is started every time; a
//! waiting chat given another reasoning level is told it with `set_thinking_level`, and one given another model gets a
//! new Pi on the same session, since Pi knows only the models of its `models.json`.
//!
//! `agents` holds the built-in agents and makes a run's agent of its configuration; `process` writes Pi's agent
//! directory (`models.json`, `mcp.json`), builds its command line and starts it; `runs` starts the runs of a card, of
//! the Retro analyst and of the Autoresearcher; `reader` reads Pi's records and ends the run; `chat` keeps a chat's Pi
//! going between messages, with its settings, and pauses an idle one; `tui` hands a waiting chat to Pi's interactive
//! mode and records what its session file gains.
