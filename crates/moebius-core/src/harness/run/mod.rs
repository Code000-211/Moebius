//! The life of a run, the same for every harness: the prompts a run of a card is told (`prompts`), the agents Moebius
//! brings itself and the agent a run uses (`agents`), making the run, its worktree and its token and undoing them when
//! its process cannot be started (`lifecycle`), starting a run on a harness's `launch` (`start`), and ending it when
//! its process is gone (`end`). Pi-Bolt (`pibolt`) and Claude Code (`claude`) keep only how they spawn their process
//! (`process`) and how they read its output into run events (`reader`).
