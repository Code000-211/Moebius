//! Automations: recurring work that runs on its own. An automation is a name, a schedule (a cron expression in the
//! server's local time, see `cron`), an agent, a prompt, where its chats work (a repository, the harness configuration
//! repository or an empty directory) and whether it is on.
//!
//! The server's schedule looks at the clock once a minute ([`on_schedule`]): each automation that is on and came due
//! since it last looked starts a chat with its agent and prompt, marked as started by the automation (`origin`
//! `automation`). A firing due while the chat of the one before still runs is recorded as skipped. A run never waits
//! for a person: once an automation's chat has answered and waits for a message, the schedule ends it, so that what it
//! changed is offered as a change and lands in the inbox, as when a person ends a chat. A firing that came due while
//! the server was not running is not made up. Each firing is recorded, with its chat, and published as
//! `automation_fired`.
