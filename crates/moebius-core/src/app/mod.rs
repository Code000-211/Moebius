//! The core put together: the store, the event bus, the repositories, the forges and the decision points, and the
//! operations the desktop API and the board engine perform on them. Every change to a card is published on the bus.
//!
//! This module holds `App` itself, its errors and the lookups every operation shares; the operations are grouped by
//! what they act on: `repositories` adds and edits repositories, `cards` keeps cards in line with their issues and
//! moves them, `runs` is a person's hand in a running run (steering, stopping, shells), `chats` starts and carries on
//! chats, `changes` publishes, offers and merges changes, `checks` runs a repository's own checks on them,
//! `localize` gives a code run the files its issue is likely to touch and records what came of it, `reproduce` runs a change's reproduction test for a repository that works test first, `whereabouts` knows where the server and the app run, and `automations` keeps
//! the automations and starts their chats when their schedules come due.
